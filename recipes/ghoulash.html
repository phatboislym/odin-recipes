    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Southern Ghoulash is a hearty one-pot meal the whole family will enjoy. It’s a quick and relatively easy 
            dish to prepare with a hearty tomato meat sauce and pasta.
            <br>
            This type of ghoulash has been very popular in the south for many years and I think everyone makes it a 
            little differently. The common ingredients are  pasta, ground beef, and tomato sauce, and many recipes call
            for cheddar cheese. I also like to add corn to mine, but that’s not as typical.
            You'll find a detailed ingredient list and step-by-step instructions in the recipe below
        </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            This ghoulash recipe is incredibly customizable, so you can easily alter the ingredient list to suit your 
            needs.
