    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Sapa Lite Noodles (SLN) recipe for when Sapa<sup>TM</sup> leave boys for neck small and we wan lavish.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        This noodles recipe is incredibly customizable, so you can easily alter the ingredient list <s>to suit your 
            needs.</s> to use whatever you have around. All you really need is some protein and maybe some veggies.
        <ul>
            If you want to stay true to the original recipe, though, these are the ingredients you'll need
            <s>to add to your grocery list</s>:
            <li>Sausages: Chicken sausages, though I s'pose you could use turkey, beef or pork sausages as well
                <s>but let's be realistic, if you had that kinda stuff you wouldn't be following this recipe</s></li>
            <li>Veggies: Carrots, cabbage, green and red peppers <s>and/or anything available that you deem fit</s></li>
            <li>Noodles: of course there's no Sapa Lite Noodles without noodles. 2 Super Packs <s>or as the spirit 
                leads</s>. I prefer Oriental Fried Noodles but any flavour is fine</li>
            <li>Egg(s): Well, you've probably gotten used to eggs as protein with your noodles, so you might as well. 
                Boiled, scrambled or as an omelette (Egg Carpet FC)</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <h3>How to Make SLN Step-By-Step</h3>

                <li>Add the sausages and veggies</li>
                <li>Allow to cook on medium heat for 3 - 5 mins (depending on how you like your noodles)</li>
